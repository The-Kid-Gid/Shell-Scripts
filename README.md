# Shell-Scripts

This is a repository of my personal bash scripts.

## update-compose

This is a script to update my docker-compose files from a private repository and run docker-compose on them. To modify it for your own use you need to change the repository referenced in the code to your own repository of docker-compose files and edit the valid servers.
